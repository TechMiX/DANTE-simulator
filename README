DANTE simulator
===============

Here is included the simulation software used to test DANTE. DANTE is a proposal
of a self-adapting P2P system, already introduced in some research papers (*).
All the results shown in those papers were obtained using this simulator.

These features were added later:
 Online replication

To start running the simulations, run this command (make sure that the 'bin/' 
dir is in your CLASSPATH):
$ java es.ladyr.dante.run.DanteAllSimsRunner

To see command line options, type:
$ java es.ladyr.dante.run.DanteAllSimsRunner --help


Notes about the simulations configuration:

It is possible to run more than one simulation using the same configuration
file. For example, if we wish to run simulations to test two different
resource replication rates (say 0.01 and 0.05) and two different loads (say 5
and 2.5 seconds between each search) we would set the 'UniformReplicationRate'
parameter to:
UniformReplicationRate = 0.01;0.05
and the 'TimeBetweenSearches' parameter to:
TimeBetweenSearches = 500000;250000

Note the ';' used to separate values.

Four simulations will be run, each with a different combination of parameter
values. Results will be stored in different files for each experiment. For
example, the resulting files for the second simulation would be (note the '2' at
the end of each file):
./DANTEResults_SearchesStatsByNode_2
./DANTEResults_SearchesStats_2
./DANTEResults_AllSearchesDigestedLog_2

Captures of the network topology are saved in different files (using the PAJEK
format). These would be stored in directory:
./DANTEResults_PajekCapturedNets_2/

Finally another file ./DANTEParams_2 will be also created, to store the specific
configuration used in that experiment.
